## 😎 Hey, I'm not your usual Rizal

Some call me **Rizal**, some call me **notRizal** —  
but most of the time, my code just calls `npm install` and cries anyway 😅

🧠 Backend enthusiast | 🛠️ Problem solver | ☕ Runs on caffeine and `console.log()`

When I'm not breaking prod (on purpose),  
I'm usually pretending to refactor code that I wrote yesterday.
